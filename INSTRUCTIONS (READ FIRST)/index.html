	<h1>Instructions</h1>
	<ol>
		<li>Go to <a href="http://codecademy.com">Codecademy</a> and select the course "HTML+CSS" to start learning how to build a webpage.  You do not have to complete the whole course (unless you want to!) - learning the HTML basics and a bit of CSS is enough.</li>
		<li>Go to <a href="https://github.com">GitHub</a> and set up your GitHub account.  Choose the free plan (unless you want to pay!).  If you are experiencing difficulties, feel free to find me :)</li>
		<li>Remember to make GitHub send a confirmation email to your email account and confirm your email account by following the steps shown on the email.  <b>This step is vital because if you do not confirm your email on GitHub, the whole webpage thing won't work.</b></li>
		<li>Name your repository/webpage.  To make it a functioning webpage, there is only one way to name your repository.  Seek me for help (unless you have figured it out or seen the instructions from GitHub).</li>
		<li>Download GitHub for Mac/Windows and clone the webpage/repository to your computer.  If you are struggling to do this, feel free to find me.</li>
		<li><h3><b><i>To start creating your webpage, you will need <a href="http://www.sublimetext.com/2">Sublime Text 2</a>.  Click on the link to go to the webpage, and download Sublime Text 2 for Mac/Windows.  If you are experiencing difficulties downloading, feel free to find me.</i></b></h3></li>
		<li>Go through the folders "choice_1" and "choice_2".  When you have chosen, copy all the documents in that folder and paste it onto your webpage.</li>
